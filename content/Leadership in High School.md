## Why leadership is important for universities?

More than 85% of servants reported that they acquired at least one leadership position in High School. (For Ivy League admitted freshmen that number is 94%). Why is that?

Needless to say, high schoolers who tend to be in charge and have organization, management, and planning skills will do well in getting a job, leading a team, and overall building their career. Those people are likely to be the heads of large companies, hold executive positions in the government, and lead a team of scientists that will make groundbreaking discoveries. All of that could add to the value of the university's name and prestige. That is why it is important for colleges to view leadership qualities in applicants' portfolios.

## What to do to show leadership qualities?

The standard leadership roles might include:

- Club leader
- Mentoring
- Working on the school newspaper
- Sport team captain
- Member of the student council

Yet, this is not a fixed list of what should you do to show your leadership skills.

By thinking a little bit outside of the box, you can add a lot more possible activities to this list.

For example:

- Fundraising money for children with oncological diseases.
- Supervising a team of volunteers.
- Helping to open an alley in your neighborhood
- Creating a project to help women deal with harassment
- Organizing interesting meetups in your school

and so many more...

Generally, if you have taken initiative in any sphere, obtained any role to make your community better, or solved some important problem, that could count as a demonstration of leadership.

## Quality > quantity

It is better to be the president of one club, that you genuinely care about and lead than it is to hold a leading position "on paper" in 5 clubs and do nothing to develop them.

_Admission officers will know that by the number of hours spend on each activity reported, essays, and interviews._

## Commitment

To be a leader means, to take responsibility, be in charge, and sometimes do things that you don't want to do.

That might be: supervising a team of other students, making and following the schedule of projects, or doing work outdoors when it is cold outside.

Although it might be hard and challenging sometimes, it can benefit you later in life.

## Why leadership might be important for you?

As a leader, you will have the opportunity to work with amazing people who can challenge your thinking and expose you to new ideas; you can not only open doors for your future but also gain valuable insights about yourself in the present. Leadership can help you discover who you are and who you want to be.
