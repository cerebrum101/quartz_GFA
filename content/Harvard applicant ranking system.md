# **How Harvard rates YOU?**

What’s up, applicants! In the contemporary world, the USA is an education powerhouse. Consequently, there is a huge competition between universities to be the best. Nevertheless, there is always one winner - Harvard University. It is not a secret that getting into Harvard is a big deal. So, today you are going to get some information about this college’s inner kitchen.

Harvard admission rates applicants on a score of 1-6 in these categories:

- **Academic**
- **Extracurricular**
- **Athletic**
- **Personal**
- **Recommendation letters** (2 teachers, counselor)
- **Alumni (interview)** personal and Overall rating

1 is the top tier, while 6 is not a big deal. Let’s dive deeper.

### **Academic:**
1. Nearly perfect marks and grades (in most cases), along with unusual creativity and perhaps original scholarship evidence.
2. A top-notch student with excellent grades and ACT scores between 33 and 37.
3. Outstanding student with mid-600s to low-700s standardized test scores (ACT scores of 29 to 32).
4. Respectable grades with ACT scores in the low to mid-600s (26 to 29).
5. Modest grades and 500 ACT scores (25 and lower).
6. Achievement or motivation marginal or worse.

### **Extracurricular:**
1. Unusual prowess in one or more disciplines. Possible national-level achievement or professional experience. An unusual feat.
2. Significant involvement in one or more secondary school activities, such as serving as class president or newspaper editor. Major accomplishments; recognition on a local or regional level.
3. Solid involvement but without special distinctiveness. (Upgrade 3+ to 2- in some circumstances if the e/c is very comprehensive and meaningful.)
4. Little or no participation.
5. Substantial activities outside of typical EC participation such as family commitments or term-time jobs.
### **Athletic:**
1. Potential recruit.
2. Strong secondary school contribution in one or more areas; possibly leadership role(s).
3. Active participation.
4. Little or no interest.
5. Significant activity outside of regular EC participation, such as commitments to family or term-time employment (could be added to other EC to raise rating; alternatively, it could be left as a "5" if it better reflects the student's commitment).
6. Physical condition prevents major activity.
### **Personal:**
1. Excellent.
2. Very Strong.
3. Somewhat positive.
4. Uninteresting, unfunny, or immature.
5. Dubious personal characteristics.
6. Dangerous personality traits.

How do they rate your “personal”? Usually, they get it from applicants' essays and other parts (family status, race, etc.), where they can grasp what type of person you are. So, they use all the information to know who you are.
### **Letter of recommendation:**
1. Startlingly uncommon assistance. Truly exaggerated statements like "the best" or "one of the best in x years."
2. Very strong support. "The best" or "One of the best this year."
3. Positive support that is above normal.
4. A little bit negative or neutral.
5. A bad or worrying report.
6. The folder lacks both the prose and the transcript.
8. A stand-in.
9. Only the transcript. No prose in SSR.

Wish y’all well.
