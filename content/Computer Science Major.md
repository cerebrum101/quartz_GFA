ðŸ‘¾ðŸ“š**What is the Computer Science major?**

Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

**What subjects are studied at this major?**
Computer science majors typically study a wide range of subjects related to computer technology, software development, and information processing. Some of the key subjects that are typically included in a computer science major program may include:

- **Programming Languages**: The study of programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, and others, as well as principles of software development.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: The study of algorithms, including how to analyze and design them, and the study of data structures, which are used to organize and store data efficiently.
- **Computer Organization and Architecture**: Involves the study of computer hardware and software, including computer components, memory management, and assembly language.
- **Operating Systems**: This involves the study of operating systems such as Windows or Linux, including process management, file systems, and memory management.
- **Database Management**: Includes the study of database management systems, including database design, SQL, and database administration.
- **Computer Networks**: The study of computer networking technologies, including protocols, routing, and network security.
- **Software Engineering**: This includes courses on software development processes, software testing, and software project management.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Includes courses on machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and other topics related to AI.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: This involves the study of how humans interact with computers and how to design effective user interfaces.
- **Cybersecurity**: This includes courses on computer security threats, cryptography, and security protocols.
- **Mathematics**: Many computer science programs also require students to take courses in mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics.

**Top Universities with full Computer Science funding:**
- Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
- Stanford University
- University of California, Berkeley
- Georgia Institute of Technology
- Carnegie Mellon University
- Nazarbayev University
- Kazakh-British Technical University
- Al-Farabi Kazakh National University
